# Difficulty Mod



## Requirements

As with most mods, you need [BepInEx](https://inscryption.thunderstore.io/package/BepInEx/BepInExPack_Inscryption/) installed. There are no other requirements.

## "Always-On" Modifications

All of these difficulty mods are considered 'always on.' That's not true, strictly speaking. 
You can toggle them on and off in the config file, but there is no user interface in game to toggle them.

### Backpack Limiter
Backpack encounters now only gain you a single consumable, even if you have none.
