# Curses!

Now refactored for Kaycee's Mod: this mod adds a number of new Challenges and Assists that you can select from when starting a new run.

If you're used the old version of this mod that adds an event to the map in Part 1, that functionality no longer exists.

The following challenges are added:

- **Haunted Past**: Deathcards will sometimes attack you in battle
- **Chaotic Enemies**: Enemies will gain additional random sigils in battle
- **Boss Revenge**: Each boss gains a third phase
- **Bigger Moon**: The moon has more health and attack
- **Two Turn Minimum**: You cannot deal lethal damage on the first turn
- **Dangerous Deck**: After each boss battle, a stick of dynamite is added to your deck

The following assists are added:

- **Extra Candle**: You gain an extra life
- **Golden Beginnings**: You start the game with a golden pelt in your deck
- **Totem Collector**: You start with all tribal totem tops
- **Minor Boon of the Bone Lord**: You start the game with a Minor Boon of the Bone Lord

## Requirements

As with most mods, you need [BepInEx](https://inscryption.thunderstore.io/package/BepInEx/BepInExPack_Inscryption/) installed. You also need the [API](https://inscryption.thunderstore.io/package/API_dev/API/)

## Installation

The zip file should be structured in the same way as your Inscryption root directory. Just drop the 'BepInEx' folder into your Inscryption directory and you're golden.
