# Difficulty Mod



## Requirements

As with most mods, you need [BepInEx](https://inscryption.thunderstore.io/package/BepInEx/BepInExPack_Inscryption/) installed. There are no other requirements.

## "Always-On" Modifications

All of these difficulty mods are considered 'always on.' That's not true, strictly speaking. 
You can toggle them on and off in the config file, but there is no user interface in game to toggle them.

### Backpack Limiter
Backpack encounters now only gain you a single consumable, even if you have none.

## Selectable Modifications

These difficulty mods can be changed by the player on a per-run basis.
Think of this as something akin to the Pact of Punishment from Hades.

### One Candle
This forces the player to only have a single candle flame available for the run.
You can't gain more from winning boss battles, and you also won't get smoke at boss battles.
