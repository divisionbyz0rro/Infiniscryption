# Side Deck Selector

Are you tired of those boring old squirrels? Have I got the thing for you...a choice between six (!!) different side decks!

You can now choose between:
- **Squirrels:** Now with the ability to block fliers!
- **Bees:** You don't even need to find the bee totem anymore - but they do have Brittle now.
- **Ants:** Want some help making those ants a little better? These 1/Ant helpers will buff your little ant army for free.
- **Squids:** These squishy and slippery things have no bones, but are really hard to pin down.
- **Puppies:** Adorable. Energetic. They move from place to place and dig up a fresh bone for you every turn.
- **Goats:** They generate twice the blood when they die, but they knock out two of your teeth for the trouble.

## Requirements

As with most mods, you need [BepInEx](https://inscryption.thunderstore.io/package/BepInEx/BepInExPack_Inscryption/) installed. 

You will also need the [API](https://inscryption.thunderstore.io/package/API_dev/API/) installed, and the super helpful [Health for Ants](https://inscryption.thunderstore.io/package/JulianMods/HealthForAnts/) mod as well.

## Installation

The zip file should be structured in the same way as your Inscryption root directory. Just drop the 'BepInEx' folder into your Inscryption directory and you're golden.

## Acknowledgements
