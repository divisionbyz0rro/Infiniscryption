# Infiniscryption
A RogueLite Mod for Inscryption

# What is Infiniscryption?
This mod aims to transform the first act of Inscryption into a run-based experience.
There have been many excellent run-based games in the past few years; this mod aims to take some of the best features of those and apply them here.



# Plugins

## "Pact of Punishment"
One of Hades' best features is the Pact of Punishment, which gives an incredible amount of replayability to the game. This is especially important in this game. One of the biggest issues with Inscryption is that the game is designed to get easier as you play (with the Oroboros, clover, the third candle, the squirrel head, the bees, etc). While we could take those features out, those features also are a huge part of the joy of the game, allowing you to build incredibly OP decks. So rather than take away your power, this mod instead aims to increase the difficulty of the game in runs after you beat it.

## Meta-currency
As with most rogue-lite games, there will be a meta-currency that you earn during runs and can apply to permanent upgrades. These currencies will be required to be spent in order to actually take posession of in-cabin rewards (such as the squirrel head, the third candle, etc).

## De-powering Items
The game's items are incredibly powerful. To reduce the ability of the player to rely on these items as crutches, item shops will only grant a single item.

## Longer maps
Maps will be longer, with more battles.

## Starter Decks (InfiniscryptionStartDecksPlugin)
Rather than starting with the same deck every time, this will give the player more choice in the construction of their initial deck.
The player will start with no cards, and will pass through custom events that will create their starting decks.

### Starter Decks:

- **Wolves**: Wolf, Wolf Cub, Coyote, Bullfrog
- **Birds**: Raven Egg, Sparrow x2, River Snapper

### Behavior

- Sets initial starting deck to be empty
- Modifies the run intro sequence to not waste time showing an empty deck (TBD)
- Modifies the map to let you pick an initial deck.
