# Infiniscryption
A rogue-lite mod project for Inscryption

# What is Infiniscryption?
This mod aims to transform the first act of Inscryption into a run-based experience, with all of the bells and whistles you would come to expect. I'm specifically going to be referencing Hades a lot in terms of design decisions and features.

My goal is to, wherever possible, make the game compatible with other mods, *especially* those that add additional cards.

## Core
Right now, this doesn't really do much to the game. It simply provides helpers to the other mods in the project. The most important is 

## Starter Decks
The starting deck for the player character is now different. Rather than being given the same starter deck every time, the player will be dealt an empty deck and then be given the option to select their starting deck in the very first event on the map. You can upgrade those decks using teeth you save at the end of a run.

## Curses
The goal of the next mod will be to build a series of difficulty modifiers to improve the overall experience of playing the game multiple times, then give an interface for players to toggle those modifiers on and off.
