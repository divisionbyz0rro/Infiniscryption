# Infiniscryption
The home for all of DivisionByZ0rro's Inscryption mods (other than the P03 In Kaycee's Mod run)

## A Personal Message from DivisionByZ0rro (7/19/2022)

It's been a while since you've heard from me. Life changes quickly. I got a bad case of Covid, I had family members get seriously injured, and was just generally unavailable for a while. 

Working on this and other Inscryption mods has been an amazing collaborative journey over the past months. Ever since I completed Inscryption for the first time in the fall of 2021, I spent all of my spare time (and then some) working on modding this game and being a part of an incredible community. But unfortunately, things change, and I cannot keep this up moving forward. I simply don't have the same amount of spare time that I used to, and it's time for me to move on.

I have nothing but gratitude for everyone who supported me and helped me accomplish what I have been able to accomplish. I know I'm leaving work unfinished, but I know that would be true no matter when I called it quits.

If anybody wants to continue any of my work, I hereby grant unrestricted permission for anyone to fork any of projects and make it their own moving forward. This work was always a passion project for the community, and I would be honored if anyone on the community wanted to continue that work. Please feel free to copy anything I've done and use it for yourself.

Thanks for everything,
