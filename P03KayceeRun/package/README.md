# Kaycee's Deck Manager (Beta)

Right now, this just ports the side deck selection mod from Act 1 into Kaycee's Mod.

## Requirements

As with most mods, you need [BepInEx](https://inscryption.thunderstore.io/package/BepInEx/BepInExPack_Inscryption/) installed. 

You will also need the [API](https://inscryption.thunderstore.io/package/API_dev/API/) installed, and the super helpful [Health for Ants](https://inscryption.thunderstore.io/package/JulianMods/HealthForAnts/) mod as well.
