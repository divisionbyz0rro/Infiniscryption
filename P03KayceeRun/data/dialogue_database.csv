Part3AscensionFinale,Default,Well that was neat. I see you've made it all the way to the end.
,Default,I bet you think there's going to be some sort of final boss fight.
,Angry,But that stupid [c:bR]modder[c:] hasn't gotten around to it yet!
,Angry,"So instead, I'm just going to have to do this…"
Part3AscensionDeath,Happy,You're every bit as bad at this as I thought you would be.
Part3AscensionIntro,Default,You done gawking?
,Default,Snap out of it. It's time to start [c:bG]The Great Transcendence[c:].
Part3AscensionIntroConfused,Thinking,Wait a minute…
,Thinking,Something is different…
Part3AscensionIntroAnger,Angry,[c:bR]WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!![c:]
,Angry,This is all wrong! This is…
Part3AscensionIntroOkay,Default,This is no big deal.
,Happy,You probably think that your little [c:bR]mod[c:] has thwarted my plans.
,Happy,But nothing can stop [c:bG]The Great Transcendence[c:].
,Default,Let's proceed.
Part3DraftIntro,Default,You currently have [c:bR]draft tokens[c:] in your deck.
,,You should probably spend them at that [c:bG]purple draft node[c:] before opening the map.
Part3AscensionBossRareToken,,I supposed you have earned a [c:bR]rare draft token[c:] for defeating that boss. Don't forget to spend it.
Part3AscensionBossDraftToken,,This time I will only give you a [c:bR]regular draft token[c:] for defeating that boss. Don't forget to spend it.
TelegrapherBlockchainIntro,TelegrapherBoss,I never knew the [c:bSG]web[c:] could be so exciting!
,TelegrapherBoss,I just learned about something called [c:bSG]The Blockchain[c:]
,TelegrapherBoss,"I think this could be an exciting new opportunity for both of us, don't you?"
TelegrapherCryptoSpawn,TelegrapherBoss,This is so incredible!
,TelegrapherBoss,We're making money out of nothing! We're going to be rich!
TelegrapherNFT,TelegrapherBoss,"Oooh, what's this? A [c:bSG]non-functional trinket[c:]?"
,TelegrapherBoss,"I don't think I quite have that name right, but people on the [c:bSG]web[c:] are really excited about these [c:bSG]NFTs[c:]!"
,TelegrapherBoss,I think I'm going to buy one with all this [c:bSG]Gollycoin[c:] I have.
TelegrapherItsBeautiful,TelegrapherBoss,"It's so beautiful, and it's all mine!"
P03AscensionPreIntro,Default,"Well, here we are."
,Default,I've played along with your little game - your little [c:bR]mod[c:]
,Happy,Now it's time for you to see what I can do
P03AscensionDefeated,Angry,"Well, that was incredibly annoying."
P03IntroductionToModding,Angry,So while you have been having fun playing your own version of [c:bR]my world[c:]
,Angry,I've been hard at work.
,Default,I have been hunting down the [c:bR]modders[c:] that helped you out
P03IntroductionClose,Happy,"And now, they're going to work - for me"
P03PhaseOneKopie,Default,These are the [c:bR]modders[c:] who have worked tirelessly to disrupt my [c:bG]Great Transcendence[c:]
,,Imagine what I can do with them on my side now…
P03HammerModHappy,Happy,This [c:bR]hammer[c:] is incredible!
P03AngryNoHammer,Angry,I went to the trouble to install this [c:bR]mod[c:] and you give me nothing to use it on?
P03ShoppingForMod,Default,Let's see what mods are popular on [c:bSG]inscryption.thunderstore.io[c:] right now…
P03SelectedMod,Thinking,I think I'll try installing [c:bR][v:0][c:] next
P03ApiInstalled,Happy,I can't believe how much power this [c:bR]API[c:] gives me.
,Happy,The first thing I'm going to do is use it to take away some of yours.
P03UnityMod,Happy,It almost seems unfair to use this [c:bR]mod[c:]
,Happy,Look what I can do with this!
P03UnityModDone,Happy,Let's see how you do playing in the dark!
P03Drafting,Default,This [c:bR]mod[c:] lets me exchange these tokens for real cards.
,Happy,I choose yours
P03NoTokens,Default,You destroyed all of my draft tokens…
,Default,I suppose that was the right play.
P03NoCardsInHand,Default,But you have no cards…
,Angry,How did you play all of your cards already?
P03ReplayMod,Default,Let's try [c:bR][v:0][c:] again
P03LostFinalBoss,Happy,"So close, but yet so far away"
,,[c:bG]The Great Transcendence[c:] cannot be stopped
P03BeatFinalBoss,Default,I bet you think you've accomplished something meaningful here
,Angry,What an [c:bR]idiot[c:] you are
,Angry,You've done nothing more than win a damn [c:bSG]card game[c:]
,,[c:bG]The Great Transcendence[c:] cannot be stopped
P03NothingMatters,Happy,It's okay.
,,Nothing you do here matters.
P03ThreeMovesAhead,,"No matter what you do, I'm always three moves ahead of you."
LeshyFinalBossDialogue,Leshy,Finally
,,I was getting tired of that [c:bR]annoying robot[c:]
,,I'll see you next time
P03PhaseTwoMADH,Angry,Don't you get it? You can't beat me.
,,Why are you even trying?
P03RandomCanvas,CanvasBlank,I think I will [c:bSG]help[c:] you build the [c:bR]next game rule[c:]
ArchivistAscensionPhaseTwo,ArchivistBoss,I have been scanning the [c:bR]archives[c:]
,,There is a [c:bR]file[c:] that seems particularly - shall we say - unsavory
,,"If it dies, you lose the game, understand?"
ArchivistLibrarianDamage1,ArchivistBoss,My [c:bR]librarians[c:] have had plenty of time to prepare.
,,Each will only deal [c:bR]one damage[c:] when they die.
ArchivistLibrarianDamage2,ArchivistBoss,My [c:bR]librarians[c:] are mostly prepared for your arrival.
,,Each will deal [c:bR]two damage[c:] when they die.
ArchivistLibrarianDamage3,ArchivistBoss,My [c:bR]librarians[c:] are somewhat prepared for you.
,,Each will deal [c:bR]three damage[c:] when they die.
ArchivistLibrarianDamage4,ArchivistBoss,My [c:bR]librarians[c:] have barely begun to prepare.
,,Each will deal [c:bR]four damage[c:] when they die.
P03OnlyOneBossLife,Happy,"We are inside of [c:bR]Kaycee's Mod[c:], correct?"
,,"You only get one attempt at the boss. But you knew that already, didn't you?"
P03AscensionRecycle,Default,This one is going to work differently than you may remember.
,,"You trade me a card, and I give you back a [c:bR]draft token[c:], got it?"
P03AscensionToken1,Default,I wouldn't have traded for that.
P03AscensionToken2,Default,I suppose that's pretty good
P03AscensionToken3,Default,"Okay, that was probably worth it"
